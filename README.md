I will be updating this Github after making significant progress with my definitions. The end goal is to have a mostly fully defined ROM. By doing so, I allow myself to have full control over my ECU as well as providing the definition base for anyone who is interested in finding some pretty critical maps not currently found in A33B's definitons. 


To view the maps, set the userlevel to "5" The maps in Debug mode (user level 5) are either unknown in terms of their function, I just haven't gotten to verifying it yet, or I'm still experimenting with it. 

In total, there are about 2,036 maps defined for CF48D. 

Important Notice;
These definitions are NOT 100% ACCURATE! I am one guy locating and defining all these maps. I have spent countless hours on this so mistakes are likely to show up. I have tried to add notes by maps that are known to need work done, but it's possible that I will miss a few. 


You are accepting the risk associated with using this definition template and I am not liable for any damage that occurs.
